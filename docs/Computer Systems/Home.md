This course covers the fundamental aspects of computer systems. It begins with an exploration of basic hardware components like gates and progresses to examine higher-level structures such as compilers, programming languages, and applications. The objective is to provide an understanding of how computer systems are structured in layers and the way simple interfaces are used to develop complex systems.

Topics include digital logic, memory systems, processor architecture, assembly language, the workings of virtual machines, recursive descent parsing, code generation, and the functions of operating systems.

## Personal Thoughts

- This class was certainly interesting to say the least. The content was incredible, and every single person on planet earth could benefit from learning low level computing. Everyone. You don't even have to like computers to learn something beneficial from this class. On the other hand, this is the least hand-holdy and disorganised class I have ever taken, by far. If you want to learn this shit, you have to learn it. No one is gonna help you. 
- Not only did the class make me a better programmer, but it also helped with my mental health. Virtual machines, compilers and stacks are such fascinating concepts that could be applied quite literally anywhere.
- [7.1 Stack Frames & Function Handling](Notes/7.1%20Stack%20Frames%20&%20Function%20Handling.md) is the personal standout of this class. Took me 7 hours to go through that chapter, but it felt like 30 minutes. That's how interesting it is. I don't even like reading. 

### Takeaways
- Stacks are cool as fuck
- Babushka dolls are basically low level computers??
- I still don't understand pointers (jk)
- If you want to learn this course but are not in Uni, take nand2tetris for free online. They basically ripped it off anyway.
