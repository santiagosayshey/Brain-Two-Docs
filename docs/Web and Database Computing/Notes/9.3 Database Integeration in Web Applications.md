- The Node.hs `mysql` module provides us with methods for interacting with our database
- To use it, there's a few extra steps we'll need

1. Install the module
2. Configure it for our RDBMS
3. Make it accessible to our routes

- Once it's setup, we can query the database

## Setup

### Installing the Module
- First we need to install the mysql module

```js
npm install --save mysql
```

### Connection to RDMBS in Express
- Need to setup in `app.js`, and create middleware for it

```js
...
// use mysql in this app
var mysql = require('mysql');

// create a 'pool' (group) of connections to be used for connecting with our SQL server
var dbConnectionPool = mysql.createPool({
 host: 'localhost',
 database: 'blog'
});

var app = express();

// Middleware for accessing database: We need access to the database to be available *before* we process routes in index.js,
// so this code needs to be *before* the app.use('/', routes);
// Express will run this function on every request and then continue with the next module, index.js.
// So for all requests that we handle in index.js, weâ€™ll be able to access the pool of connections using req.pool

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
 req.pool = dbConnectionPool;
 next();
});

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
...
```

### Accessing the Database Conneciton
- Now that we've configured our express server to be able to connect to the database, we can use that config in our routes

```js
router.get('/result', function(req, res) {
 //Connect to the database
 req.pool.getConnection(function(err,connection) {
 if (err) {
 res.sendStatus(500);
 return;
 }
 });
});

```

- Recall that our middleware sets `req.pool` to our database pool that we created in the `app.js` file
- `getConnection()` is a function in the mysql module that connects to the mysql database
- The callback function will have `err` and `connection` as parameters
	- `connection` is the connection to the database


## Querying the Database
- A basic quiery

```js
router.get('/result', function(req, res, next) {

	 //Connect to the database
	 req.pool.getConnection( function(err,connection) {
		 if (err) {
			 res.sendStatus(500);
			 return;
		 }
		 
		 var query = "SHOW TABLES";
		 
		 connection.query(query, function(err, rows, fields) {
			 connection.release(); // release connection
			 
			 if (err) {
				 res.sendStatus(500);
				 return;
			 }
			 
			 res.json(rows); //send response
		 });
	 });
});
```

- Once we've established a connection, we can run or more queries using `connection.query()`
- The `connection.qeury()` method takes:
	- A SQL query string (the same as we've been writing)
	- The function to run when the query returns results
- Once the query is completed. the call function is run
	- If we are done with the database for this request, we should close it immediately, this will allow other requests to access the database
- The callback function will have `err, rows and fields` as parameters
	- `rows` is an array of ibjects containing the results of the query


### Prepared Statements
- What if we want to use information from the request in our query?

```js
 var username = req.query.username; // if username was a field in the request URL
 var query = "SELECT date,contents FROM posts WHERE author = ?";
 
 connection.query(query, [username], function(err, rows, fields) {
	 connection.release(); // release connection
	 
	 if (err) {
		 res.sendStatus(500);
		 return;
	 }
	 res.json(rows); //send response
 });

```

- The `connection.query()` method takes:
	- An SQL query string
	- An array of paramters that we want to include as part of the query
	- The function to run when the query returns results
- If the query requires fata from the client to run (or other external sources), `?` placeholders are used
	- `?` placeholders are replaced with the values in the parameters array (like how printf works in C)
	- Using placeholders like this keeps our SQL secure. These are called **prepared statements**

### Query Reponse Format
- In the previous function, the rows selected by the query are directly sent to the client

```js
connection.query(query, function(err, rows, fields) {

 connection.release(); // release connection
 
 if (err) {
	 res.sendStatus(500);
	 return;
 }
 
 res.json(rows); //send response
});
```

- This data looks like:

```json
[ 
RowDataPacket { 
				date: 2016-01-23T10:45:48.000Z,
				contents: 'Lorem ipsum dolor' 
			},
				
RowDataPacket { 
				 date: 2016-02-15T02:51:32.000Z,
				 contents: 'Phasellus aliquam, leo' 
		   } 
 ]
```

- We can send this as `JSON`

#### How do we use this data in code?
- Same way we access other values in objects, for example:

```js
rows[0].contents // will give us the string 'Lorem ipsum dolor' from row 0
rows[1].date     // will give us the date 2016-02-15T02:51:32.000Z from row 1
```

- Or, we can send the response straight to the client as JSON

```js
res.json(rows);
```

- The `RowDataPacket` information is stripped away
- Once converted back to JSON, the client can access the data the same way as described above
